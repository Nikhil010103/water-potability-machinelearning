# Water Potability Analysis Using Supervised Machine Learning
This project applies supervised machine learning algorithms to predict the potability of water based on various quality parameters. The dataset includes key factors such as pH, turbidity, dissolved COâ‚‚, conductivity, hardness, alkalinity, and free chlorine, which influence water quality. By analyzing these parameters, the model classifies water samples as potable (safe) or non-potable (unsafe).

The repository covers data preprocessing, feature selection, and the implementation of multiple ML algorithms to achieve optimal prediction accuracy. This project demonstrates the practical use of machine learning in water quality assessment, helping ensure access to safe drinking water through data-driven insights.

The dataset was sourced from Kaggle, and the CSV file has been uploaded in the repository for reference.
